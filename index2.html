    Among  sky burial places, Drigung Monastery's sky burial site is the tallest and largest one. In Tibetan, it means the place of eternal life.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>In the Ancient History of Xianxiong and Tibetan Tubo Dynasty, the vulture is called the "sacred bird" and no one can hurt it.
    The Bon religion believes that the vulture is a medium between human and heaven, bringing human souls to the invisible world of bliss.
   In this way, the vulture became the messenger of heaven and earth. With a place to give full play to its doctrine, the Bon religion also has a reasonable explanation for the sky burial, and more mysterious and religious, so the man-made sky burial began.
   </p>
<h3>Religion and culture</h3>
<p>When Buddhism was introduced to Tibet, it naturally clashed with the Bon religion. Tibetan Buddhism began to enter every aspect of people's life.
    Sky burial also evolved from a purely Bon religion domination to a funeral culture phenomenon with Tibetan Buddhist thought as the main content.
   </p>
<p>Therefore, people spare no effort to practice and pray for a good afterlife. 

    After death, Tibetans are very concerned about the destination of the soul, hoping that there is a shortcut to help the soul go to the heavenly realm, so the vulture in the sky burial becomes a prop to fulfill this wish.
    
    The ritual of sky burial has the worship of the sky, the taboo on the dead body, clothing and other legacy of the Bon religion, but also the "six reincarnations", karma(the spiritual principle of cause and effect) and other Tibetan Buddhist ideas, so more religious.

<p>Tibetan Buddhists believe that the corpse is nothing but a discarded shell. The spirit of the deceased has already moved on, through death and toward a new incarnation. For Buddhists in Tibet , offering their bodies to vultures or birds is the last great and honorable thing to do. 

    With sky burial, there is no need to disturb the land to bury the body. This also expresses a value for environmental protection.
    
    sky burial is a kind of belief expressing people’s mourning of the deceased, which is essentially a social and cultural phenomenon influenced by the religion, natural geographical environment, mode of production and other factors.
