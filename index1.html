<p>Sky burial<sup>天葬</sup>
    is a funeral practice in which a human corpse is placed on a mountaintop to decompose while exposed to the elements or to be eaten by vultures. 
    It is a specific type of the general practice of excarnation.
     It is practiced in the region of Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia, as well as in Mongolia, Bhutan and parts of India. 
</p>Sky burials (or celestial burials, as they are also called) are the burial rites of choice for the Tibetans. After a member of the community has died, the body is cut into pieces by a Burial Master, and then taken to a selected site, usually in an area of high elevation. This is because the corpse is then supposed to be eaten by vultures, who tend to congregate at higher altitudes. <br />

 <h3>1.Preparation</h3>
 <p>After death, the body is wrapped carefully with a white traditional cloth. 
    The body is then laid in a cleaned corner in the house where the dead person used to live.
     The body is not to be disturbed as this might interrupt the souls’ transition into rebirth.
    The body remains in the house for at most five days after which it should be disposed off. 
    During this period, the family invites the monks or the Lamas who read the Holy Scriptures to the dead. It can expel the soul from the body and cleanses it from worldly sins.
<h3> Body disposal</h3>
<p>The final step of laying the soul to rest is feeding the body to the vultures. 
    The family of the dead, therefore, selects a day for the sky burial, calling it a ‘ lucky day.’
   The body is unwrapped and bent into a fetal position to symbolize rebirth into another world. The body carrier is then called upon to take the body to the burial site.
   The carrier deposits the body of the dead, usually, there are several in number, at the burial site and uses mulberry smoke to attract the starving vultures. 
   The Lamas offer prayers as the vultures devour the corpses.<br />
